### Comp 20, lab 7
This web page demonstrates the use of the localstorage in the browser. I used jquery framework for this web page. Using javascript and jquery the web page takes input from the textbox, shows in the page with a time stamp which is generated using javascript Date object. Then the text is also stored in the browser's localstorage. When the page is refreshed old data from localstorage is retrieved and shown in the same order with time stamps. I spent around 1 hour doing this assignment
