Ride Sharing Service

This client side web page makes use of the google map api, the html5 navigator.geolocation and the ride sharing api hosted in heroku. First of all a map is loaded. Then the geolocation object points the location of the device and returns lattitude and longitude values, which is used to center the map and display a marker showing self. Then a post request on the server using xmlhttprequest object provides a json file containing info about passengers or the drivers depending on who we are.

This project took about 7 hours to complete.
