#### This Github repository contains most of the assignments and labs I did for the Web Programming class. It contains the complete source code for the assignments.
#### My favourite assignment was the server side assignment 3. I liked it because it was interesting to make the server side do complex and security requiring tasks that normally can't be done in the client side.
#### Although I knew a little bit of all html, css and javascript before taking the class, I have now understood the fundamentals of these tools and also HTTP. I have learnt how to efficiently learn myself with a little help of goolgle and stack overflow.
#### One of the most important thing I learnt in this class is learning new things on the go. I have gotten stuck in the assignments multiple times and the knowledge I found online have helped me remove confusion. Another important thing I learnt in this class is the working of HTTP. Although it is the simple version that we learnt, I feel that it has helped a lot in the designing and building web apps.
#### I would like to delve deeper into networks in the very low level.
