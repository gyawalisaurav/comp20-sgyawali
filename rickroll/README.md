#### Rickroll assignment
This assignment demonstrates the use of javascript to create an interactive website. The page makes use of an event lisetner that gets triggered when the time of the video gets updated. After comparing the video time with pre-defined times the respective stanza is displayed in the document. This page uses Javascript's DOM. I spent an hour and a half for this assignment.
